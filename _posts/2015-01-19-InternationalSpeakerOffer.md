Driven has put together a package deal for international speakers that would like to visit South Africa and run workshops.

The offer has evolved from a structure we have used for several people already (Rinat Abdullin, Vaughn Vernon, Greg Young). It is as follows:

# Heuristics for speaker/topic selection 
* Workshops must be of interest to those working in software development fields
* Workshops should be principle based (how/when/why), not strictly practice based (what). For example a workshop on TDD would suit, a workshop on xUnit would probably not.
* Confirmation of workshop is dependent on sufficient bookings being placed to cover costs.

# You (Speaker) Provide

* Workshop topic
* Date(s) you are available
* Minimum & maximum number of people in the workshop

# We (Driven) Provide 

* Turnkey running of the workshop, from marketing to bookings to venue etc.
* Booking of your accommodation over the period of the workshop
* Personally meet you at airport and see you are safely returned for your next flight

# Proposed Commercial Model

* We collect all money from bookings locally
* We deduct agreed expenses - flights, accommodation and food/drinks, venue costs
* The remaining balance, if any, is shared half to the speaker and half to Driven

If you would like to take advantage of this offer, contact speakersafari@drivenalliance.com
