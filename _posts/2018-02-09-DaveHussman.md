David Hussman, founder of DevJam and previous winner of the Gordon Pask Award, is in South Africa to keynote the 3rd annual [DevConf](http://devconf.co.za) conference.

Whilst he is here he has kindly agreed to run a _one day only_ workshop in Johannesburg on the 28th March, to teach some of the deeper concepts of building product effective product teams. 

This is David's second trip to South Africa after keynoting at Agile Africa in 2014, and we are very excited to have him back again, after all we learned from him last time.

# Course Description

Building on, but going far beyond the basics of the Scrum and Agile world, this course draws on years of success building whole product teams where everyone cares about customer and product learning. 

Each student will select a product or business idea to explore. The day will be spent unpacking the idea with lean UX and emergent product discovery techniques. From initial framing to incremental validation, we will discuss why, who, what, and where you think you should start learning about your product idea, helping you make tough choices along the way. 

Time permitting, we will discuss how to adopt or introduce these ideas into your current eco-system, identifying constraints and ideas for overcoming one or more of them. 

The skills from the course will be applicable to your working life immediately. 

# Audience

People who often attend are product owners, product managers, managers, and technologists who are looking to expand their skills. In truth, anyone who wants to grow product ownership and learn faster how much of what they thought was needed, truly is needed. Or put another way, if you can learn to build less of the wrong thing sooner, you can do more with your existing bandwidth.

# Agenda 
* Discuss student goals for the day
* Select an idea, product or business, to explore and pitch it to someone
* **Why:** Frame up the idea by exploring what success might look like within a named time frame, focusing on measurable successes that matter to the company (e.g. KPIs). This is the first step in narrowing your choice as a way to learn sooner.
* **Who:** List out and explore the people who will validate your idea: various customers and consumers as well as the often undiscussed “indirect” audience like admins
* **What:** Using the customers as guides, create visual planning tools like story maps as aids for story telling and deeper discovery. Time permitting, we may explore other discovery tools that help explode “what” for the various validators previously named
* **Where:** Further narrowing the discovery in the previous steps, students with use ideas like customer journeys and product slices to step towards planning that is customer and product focused.
* **Why:** Closing out the discovery learning for the day, students will work on tying back and augmenting the validation ideas from the framing, narrowing the focus for learning and improving the fidelity of the validation measures.
* We will close by fielding your questions about the techniques, how to introduce them into your eco-system, and touch a bit on how these tools can be used to create a cadence of continuous discovery.

David teaches and coaches product discovery through iterative delivery. He has spent the last 15 years coaching agility and producing products for companies of all sizes around the world. 

David’s coaching is non-dogmatic and pragmatic. His focus on getting to know a project community allows him to seed self-discovery and avoid falling into the expert trap of simply telling people what they “should do". 

David spends most of his time with teams, helping them create and validate product ideas and roadmaps with responsive engineering. He also works with leadership teams to pragmatically introduce the type of lasting agility that fosters innovation and creates a competitive edge. 

David was awarded The Gordon Pask Award and has contributed to Agile at Scale, Story Mapping, and many other publications and presentations that can be found on-line.
